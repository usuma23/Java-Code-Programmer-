Overview:
This repository contains four different Java programs demonstrating various concepts in programming and algorithms. Each program serves a unique purpose and showcases fundamental coding techniques.

Merge Sort:
This program implements the Merge Sort algorithm, which is a divide-and-conquer algorithm used to sort an array.

Features:

Takes user input for the array size and elements.
Sorts the array using the Merge Sort technique.
Displays the sorted array.
Usage:
Run the program.
Enter the number of elements in the array.
Input the elements to be sorted.
The program will output the sorted array.

Quick Sort:
This program implements the Quick Sort algorithm, which is also a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays.

Features:
Takes user input for the array size and elements.
Sorts the array using the Quick Sort technique.
Displays the sorted array.

Usage:
Run the program.
Enter the number of elements in the array.
Input the elements to be sorted.
The program will output the sorted array.

Simple Calculator:
This program implements a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features:
Takes user input for two numbers and an operation.
Performs the specified operation.
Displays the result.

Usage:
Run the program.
Input the first number.
Input the second number.
Choose an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
The program will output the result.

Voting System:
This program simulates a simple voting system where users can vote for candidates and display the results.

Features:
Allows users to cast votes for predefined candidates.
Displays the total votes for each candidate.
Handles user input for voting.

Usage:
Run the program.
Follow the prompts to cast your vote for one of the candidates.
The program will display the total votes for each candidate.

How to Run:
Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
Clone the repository or download the Java files.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the Java files are located.
Compile the Java files using the command:
javac Main.java
Run the program using the command:
java Main
